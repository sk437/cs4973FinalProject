I spent like 4 hours trying to get a one-line install to work but couldn't do it so here are the commands for each package individually
(do this in conda environment)
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
conda install transformers
conda install datasets
conda install pandas
conda install sentencepiece
conda install "dill<0.3.5"
